# Energy Market Balancing - Frontend

## Overview

The **Energy Market Balancing** frontend application is designed to visualize balancing circles, their members, and forecasted inflows and outflows in the energy market. Built with Angular, it provides a user-friendly interface for calculating and displaying energy imbalances.

### Context

The frontend serves as the interface for users to interact with the energy market balancing data. By displaying the total inflows and outflows for each balancing circle, users can easily visualize energy production and consumption. The application enables users to drill down into member-level details and monitor imbalances, which is critical for maintaining grid stability.

**Imbalance(t) = Inflows(t) - Outflows(t)**

- **Inflows**: Forecasted energy produced by sources like solar farms and wind parks.
- **Outflows**: Forecasted energy consumed by clients or industrial entities.

The goal of the frontend is to provide insights into the energy balancing process, assisting users in managing imbalances effectively.

## Features

- Display a list of balancing circles and their associated members.
- Show detailed member-level forecasts and imbalance data.
- Responsive design for optimal viewing on various devices.
- Integration with the backend API for real-time data fetching.
